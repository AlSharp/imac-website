***IMAC or INTELLIDRIVES MULTI-AXIS MOTION and AUTOMATION CONTROLLER*** is a network based general purpose motion/automation controller with embedded intuitive visual programming capability.

## IMAC Editor

**IMAC Editor** is software application that runs in the web browser and uses graphical blocks to create complex sequences for controlling different stepper and servo motors, digital and analog I/O and vision systems.

Graphical blocks represent motion commands, control of the input/output devices, variables, logic expressions, math, loops and more. User doesn't have to worry about complexities of the programming languages.

## Hardware

**IMAC** controls network of Digital Stepper and Servo **I-DRIVESâ„¢** as well as digital and analog I/O.
**IMAC** can operate as a stand-alone system or connected to the user network or Internet.
As a stand-alone controller, IMAC can take the place of a PC in a control system to reduce cost. 
**IMAC** can also be configured to work in conjunction with a PC where the IMAC handles the real-time processes such as motion control and automation, and the PC is used as programming environment and GUI

#### Main Features:
-	Multi-axis (up to 32 axes) motion control
-	Handling Digital and Analog I/O
-	Simple and Visual creation of complex machine operational sequences
-	No programming experience necessary, just lay graphical blocks in sequence
-	Graphical HMI Designer
