### Motion Blocks

#### Mode

Sets the type of the motor and the mode in which motor works.

<figure>
  <img src="assets/blocks/mode_1.png" alt="Mode tile"/>
  <img src="assets/blocks/mode_2.png" alt="Mode block"/>
</figure>

*Motor type*:
+ Stepper
+ Servo

*Acceleration*: positive integer or [variable] (units: counts/sec^2)

*Deceleration*: positive integer or [variable] (units: counts/sec^2)

*Jerk*: positive integer or [variable] (units: counts/sec^3)

>Sets the motion profile, velocity, acceleration, deaceleration and jerk for axis `X` on the port name `XYZ`.

#### Move

Sets the type of motion, absolute position or relative distance, direction of the motion. By default the checkbox `Wait until done` is checked and that means that next block in the sequence will not be executed until the motion is completed.

<figure>
  <img src="assets/blocks/move_1.png" alt="Move tile"/>
  <img src="assets/blocks/move_2.png" alt="Move block"/>
  <img src="assets/blocks/move_3.png" alt="Move block"/>
  <img src="assets/blocks/move_4.png" alt="Move block"/>
</figure>

*Type*:
+ Absolute

  Uses when you need to move the axis relative to current homing position.

+ Relative

  Uses when you need to move the axis relative to current position.

+ Velocity

  Uses when you need to move the axis at a constant velocity in the selected direction.

*Position*: positive or negative integer or [variable] (units: counts)

*Distance*: positive or negative integer or [variable] (units: counts)

*Direction*: [*Positive / Negative*]

>Multiplies the value of position or distance by `1` if Positive, and `-1` if Negative.

*Wait until done*: [*True / False*]

>Sets motion type to *`Absolute`* or *`Relative`* or *`Velocity`*, moves to absolute position in counts if motion type is *`Absolute`*, moves given counts if motion type is relative, sets direction of motion to positive or negative, sets option "wait until done" to *`True`* or *`False`* for axis `X` on the port name `XYZ`.

#### Homing

Sets the homing position.

<figure>
  <img src="assets/blocks/homing_1.png" alt="Homing tile"/>
  <img src="assets/blocks/homing_2.png" alt="Homing block"/>
  <img src="assets/blocks/homing_3.png" alt="Homing block"/>
  <img src="assets/blocks/homing_4.png" alt="Homing block"/>
</figure>

*Method*:
+ Current position

  Use when the currect position is needed to be set as homing position.

+ Limit switch

  Use when one of limits is needed to be set as homing position.

+ Home switch

  Use when home switch is needed to be set as homing position.

*Direction*: [*Positive / Negative*]

>Works only with *`Limit switch`* and *`Home switch`* methods.
If Limit switch method is elected, indicates that ***positive*** or ***negative*** limit switch is selected to be a homing position.
If Home switch is selected, indicates the direction the axis should move in to get to the home switch.

*Wait until referenced*: [*Always true*]

Waits for axis completes the homing positioning.

> Sets homing method to *`Current position`* or *`Limit Switch`* or *`Home Switch`*, sets direction of homing positioning to positive or negative for axis `X` on the port `XYZ`. Always waits until referenced.

### Time / Event Blocks

#### Wait for digital input

Waits for `High` or `Low` on selected digital input. The next block in the sequence will be executed only if expected value comes on given input.

<figure>
  <img src="assets/blocks/wait_input_1.png" alt="Wait Input tile"/>
  <img src="assets/blocks/wait_input_2.png" alt="Wait Input block"/>
</figure>

*Input*: number of input or [variable] (units: positive integer)

*Wait for*: input state or [variable] (units: Hi / Lo or 1 / 0)

> Waits for *`Hi`* on input *`3`* for axis `X` on the port `XYZ`.

#### Listen to event

Listens to events. The next block in the sequence will be executed only if awaited event happens.

<figure>
  <img src="assets/blocks/listen_event_1.png" alt="Listen to Event tile"/>
  <img src="assets/blocks/listen_event_2.png" alt="Listen to Event block"/>
</figure>

*Event*:
+ Positive limit switch
+ Negative limit switch

*Timeout*: [*ms*]

If during the specified time the event is not occurred, the error will be thrown and the further processing of the sequence of blocks will be stopped.

Awaits the positive limit switch is triggered at the axis `0` on the port `USB0`.

#### Delay

Waits for specified milliseconds.

<figure>
  <img src="assets/blocks/delay_1.png" alt="Delay tile"/>
  <img src="assets/blocks/delay_2.png" alt="Delay block"/>
</figure>

*Time*: [*ms*]

Waits for the specified time. The next block in the sequence will be executed only after the time is expired.

#### Wait until done

Waits until the motion launched by previous block is completed.

<figure>
  <img src="assets/blocks/wait_until_done_1.png" alt="Wait until done tile"/>
  <img src="assets/blocks/wait_until_done_2.png" alt="Wait until done block"/>
</figure>

Example:

<figure>
  <img src="assets/blocks/wait_until_done_example.png" alt="Wait until done example"/>
</figure>

The block **`Wait until done`** checks the motion at axis `0` on the port `USB0`. If the motion does not exist (or the motion is ended) the next block in the sequence will be allowed to run.

### I/O Blocks

#### Set digital output

Sets the output control register to `High` or `Low`.

<figure>
  <img src="assets/blocks/set_output_1.png" alt="Set Output tile"/>
  <img src="assets/blocks/set_output_2.png" alt="Set Output block"/>
</figure>

*Output*: [*1 - 4*]

*Set to*: [*Hi / Lo*]

When output is set to *Hi* output transistor is open, conducting current to the load.

When output is set *Lo* output transistor is closed, no current flows to the load.

#### Read digital input

Reads the value of input.

<figure>
  <img src="assets/blocks/read_input_1.png" alt="Read Input tile"/>
  <img src="assets/blocks/read_input_2.png" alt="Read Input block"/>
</figure>

*Input*: [*1 - 12*]

Reads the value of specified input and saves this value in the program's internal memory. The value can be used in the IF-ELSE statement. Also the value can be assigned to variable name.

### Control Flow Blocks

#### Repeat

Opens the beginning of the repeated part of the sequence of blocks.

<figure>
  <img src="assets/blocks/repeat_1.png" alt="Repeat tile"/>
  <img src="assets/blocks/repeat_2.png" alt="Repeat block"/>
</figure>

*Id*: positive integer or word without special characters
+ should be unique. Identifies a chain of blocks that will be repeated.

*Number*: positive integer
+ defines how many times blocks will be repeated.

Says to IMAC interpreter that starting from the next block there is a chain of blocks ended with *End Repeat* block with the same `Id` and that chain of blocks should be repeated `Number` times.

#### End Repeat

Defines the end of the repeated part of the sequence of blocks.

<figure>
  <img src="assets/blocks/end_repeat_1.png" alt="End Repeat tile"/>
  <img src="assets/blocks/end_repeat_2.png" alt="End Repeat block"/>
</figure>

*Id*: positive integer or word without special characters
+ should be matched to `Id` of Repeat block.

Says to IMAC interpreter that here is the end of a chain of blocks started with *Repeat* block with the same `Id`.

#### If

Checks its boolean condition.

<figure>
  <img src="assets/blocks/if_1.png" alt="If tile"/>
  <img src="assets/blocks/if_2.png" alt="If block"/>
</figure>

*Id*: positive integer or word without special characters
+ should be unique. It is needed to find associated *Else* and *End if* blocks.

*First boolean condition*:
+ Inputs [IN1 - IN12] [= , &ne;] [*Hi, Lo*]
+ [*variable*] [=, &ne;, &gt;, &ge;, &lt;, &le;] [*variable*]

*Checkbox*: [*OR, AND*]

*Second boolean condition*:
+ Inputs [IN1 - IN12] [= , &ne;] [*Hi, Lo*]
+ [*variable*] [=, &ne;, &gt;, &ge;, &lt;, &le;] [*variable*]

If the condition is true the next blocks will be executed until IMAC interpreter meets associated *Esle* block or *End If* block. If the condiction is false the next blocks will be skipped and IMAC interpreter will look for assocciated *Else* block or *End If* block to continue execution of the blocks.

##### *Sample use case*

<figure>
  <img src="assets/blocks/if_else_example_1.png" alt="If-Else example"/>
  <img src="assets/blocks/if_else_example_2.png" alt="If-Else example"/>
  <img src="assets/blocks/if_else_example_3.png" alt="If-Else example"/>
</figure>

If **Input 3** is `High` then move **axis 0** `10000` counts in positive direction else move **axis 0** `10000` counts in negative direction.

#### Else

Says to the interpreter to start the execution of the blocks *"from here"* if the boolean condition of associated *If* block is false.

<figure>
  <img src="assets/blocks/else_1.png" alt="Else tile"/>
  <img src="assets/blocks/else_2.png" alt="Else block"/>
</figure>

*Id*: positive integer or word without special characters
+ should be matched to associated *If* block.

#### End If

Says to the interpreter that this is the end of *If* or *If-Else* statement.

<figure>
  <img src="assets/blocks/end_if_1.png" alt="End If tile"/>
  <img src="assets/blocks/end_if_2.png" alt="End If block"/>
</figure>

*Id*: positive integer or word without special characters
+ should be matched to associated *If* block.

## Updating IMAC Software

IMAC applications are under the active development. Improvements and new features are being added. Users ask to add new blocks with custom functionality. When the new IMAC software version is available, user can update the application. There are two way to update application:

1. Over the Internet

The link of updated version will be provided. Go to _Main Menu_ => _Update_ and click _Online_. The dialog box will be displayed.

![IMAC Update Online](assets/update_online.png "IMAC Update Online")

Insert provided URL into the text field and click Update. The progress of installation can be observed in the terminal. When the installation is completed application will be reloaded. Type `version` into the terminal and press Enter to verify that application is updated successfully.

2.	From the zipped file on the user hard drive. User will be provided with link to new version for downloading. Downloaded zip file can be saved on local PC. Go to _Main Menu_ => _Update_ and click Offline. The dialog box will be displayed.

![IMAC Update Offline](assets/update_offline.png "IMAC Update Offline")

Click _Choose File_. The standard Windows File Explorer window will be displayed. Navigate to the saved zip file and open it. Click Update. The progress of installation can be observed in the terminal. When the installation is completed application will be reloaded. Type `version` into the terminal and press Enter to verify that application is updated successfully.

## Sending ASCII commands through the terminal

User has a full control over the **IDRIVES** through the Terminal. Refer to the _ASCII Programmerâ€™s Guide_ for available commands and syntax. The syntax of IMAC ASCII message is:

[_usb port_]:[_axis letter_][_command code_][_command parameters_]

Examples:

```js
usb0: 1 g r0x70
```

Get the value of register `0x70` at axis `1` of **IDRIVE** connected to USB port 0.

```js
usb0: 0 s r0xc8 0
```

Set the trajectory generator to absolute move, trapezoidal profile

```js
usb0: t 2
```

Execute homing.
