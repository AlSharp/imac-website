![Visual Block Programming Environment](assets/vbpi.png "Visual Block Programming Environment")

## Block Palette

Block palette contains the following command block categories:

- Motion Blocks
- Time / Event Blocks
- I/O Blocks
- Control Flow Blocks
- Math Blocks
- Variable Blocks
- Mics. Blocks
- User Blocks

### Motion Blocks

#### Mode

Allows to set type of the motor and the mode in which motor works.

![get_started_mode_1_index](assets/blocks/mode_1.png "Mode block")
![get_started_mode_2_index](assets/blocks/mode_2.png "Mode block")

*Motor type*:
+ Stepper
+ Servo

*Operating mode*:
+ Position

Sets the motor ***type*** to *`Stepper`* and operating ***mode*** to *`Position`* for axis `0` on the port `USB0`.

#### Profile

Allows to set the motion characteristics.

![get_started_profile_1_index](assets/blocks/profile_1.png "Profile block")
![get_started_profile_2_index](assets/blocks/profile_2.png "Profile block")
![get_started_profile_3_index](assets/blocks/profile_3.png "Profile block")

*Profile*:
+ trapezoidal
+ s-curve

*Velocity*: positive integer [*counts/sec*]

*Acceleration*: positive integer [*counts/sec^2*]

*Deacceleration*: positive integer [*counts/sec^2*]

*Jerk*: positive integer [*counts/sec^3*]

Sets the motion ***profile***, ***velocity***, ***acceleration***, ***deaceleration*** and ***jerk*** for axis `0` on the port `USB0`.

#### Move

Allows to set the type of motion, absolute position or relative distance, direction of the motion. By default the checkbox `Wait until done` is checked and that means that next block in the sequence will not be executed until the motion is completed.

![get_started_move_1_index](assets/blocks/move_1.png "Move block")
![get_started_move_2_index](assets/blocks/move_2.png "Move block")
![get_started_move_3_index](assets/blocks/move_3.png "Move block")

*Type*:
+ Absolute

  Uses when you need to move the axis relative to current homing position.

+ Relative

  Uses when you need to move the axis relative to current position.

*Position*: positive or negative integer [*counts*]

*Distance*: positive or negative integer [*counts*]

*Direction*: [*Positive / Negative*]

Multiplies the value of ***position*** or ***distance*** by `1` if Positive, and `-1` if Negative.

*Wait until done*: [*True / False*]

Sets motion ***type*** to *`Absolute`* or *`Relative`*, ***position*** to absolute position in counts, ***direction*** to positive or negative, ***distance*** to relative position in counts, ***wait until done*** to *`True`* or *`False`* for axis `0` on the port `USB0`.

#### Homing

Allows to set the homing position.

![get_started_homing_1_index](assets/blocks/homing_1.png "Homing block")
![get_started_homing_2_index](assets/blocks/homing_2.png "Homing block")
![get_started_homing_3_index](assets/blocks/homing_3.png "homing block")

*Method*:
+ Current position

  Uses when the currect position is needed to be set as homing position.

+ Limit switch

  Uses when one of limits is needed to be set as homing position.

*Direction*: [*Positive / Negative*]

Works only with *`Limit switch`* method. Indicates that ***positive*** or ***negative*** limit switch is selected to be a homing position.

*Wait until referenced*: [*True / False*]

Waits for axis completes the homing positioning.

Sets homing ***method*** to *`Current position`* or *`Limit Switch`*, ***direction*** to positive or negative, ***wait until referenced*** to *`True`* or *`False`* for axis `0` on the port `USB0`.

### Time / Event Blocks

#### Wait for digital input

Waits for `High` or `Low` on digital input. The next block in the sequence will be executed only if expected value comes on given input.

![get_started_wait_input_1_index](assets/blocks/wait_input_1.png "Wait digital input block")
![get_started_wait_input_2_index](assets/blocks/wait_input_2.png "Wait digital input block")

*Input*: [*1 - 12*]

*Wait for*: [*Hi / Lo*]

Waits for *`Hi`* on input *`1`* for axis `0` on the port `USB0`.

#### Listen to event

Listens to events. The next block in the sequence will be executed only if awaited event happens.

![get_started_listen_to_event_1_index](assets/blocks/listen_event_1.png "Listen to event block")
![get_started_listen_to_event_2_index](assets/blocks/listen_event_2.png "Listen to event block")

*Event*:
+ Positive limit switch
+ Negative limit switch

*Timeout*: [*ms*]

If during the specified time the event is not occurred, the error will be thrown and the further processing of the sequence of blocks will be stopped.

Awaits the positive limit switch is triggered at the axis `0` on the port `USB0`.

#### Delay

Waits for specified milliseconds.

![get_started_delay_1_index](assets/blocks/delay_1.png "Delay block")
![get_started_delay_2_index](assets/blocks/delay_2.png "Delay block")

*Time*: [*ms*]

Waits for the specified time. The next block in the sequence will be executed only after the time is expired.

#### Wait until done

Waits until the motion launched by previous block is completed.

![get_started_wait_until_done_1_index](assets/blocks/wait_until_done_1.png "Wait until done block")
![get_started_wait_until_done_2_index](assets/blocks/wait_until_done_2.png "Wait until done block")

Example:

![get_started_wait_until_done_example_index](assets/blocks/wait_until_done_example.png "Wait until done example")

The block **`Wait until done`** checks the motion at axis `0` on the port `USB0`. If the motion does not exist (or the motion is ended) the next block in the sequence will be allowed to run.

### I/O Blocks

#### Set digital output

Sets the output control register to `High` or `Low`.

![get_started_set_output_1_index](assets/blocks/set_output_1.png "Set digital output block")
![get_started_set_output_2_index](assets/blocks/set_output_2.png "Set digital output block")

*Output*: [*1 - 4*]

*Set to*: [*Hi / Lo*]

When output is set to *Hi* output transistor is open, conducting current to the load.

When output is set *Lo* output transistor is closed, no current flows to the load.

#### Read digital input

Reads the value of input.

![get_started_read_input_1_index](assets/blocks/read_input_1.png "Read digital input block")
![get_started_read_input_2_index](assets/blocks/read_input_2.png "Read digital input block")

*Input*: [*1 - 12*]

Reads the value of specified input and saves this value in the program's internal memory. The value can be used in the IF-ELSE statement. Also the value can be assigned to variable name.

### Control Flow Blocks

#### Repeat

Repeat block opens the beginning of the repeated part of the sequence of blocks.

![get_started_repeat_1_index](assets/blocks/repeat_1.png "Repeat block")
![get_started_repeat_2_index](assets/blocks/repeat_2.png "Repeat block")

*Id*: positive integer or word without special characters
+ should be unique. Identifies a chain of blocks that will be repeated.

*Number*: positive integer
+ defines how many times blocks will be repeated.

Says to IMAC interpreter that starting from the next block there is a chain of blocks ended with End Repeat block with the same `Id` and that chain of blocks should be repeated `Number` times.

#### End Repeat

End Repeat block defines the end of the repeated part of the sequence of blocks.

![get_started_end_repeat_1_index](assets/blocks/end_repeat_1.png "End Repeat block")
![get_started_end_repeat_2_index](assets/blocks/end_repeat_2.png "End Repeat block")

*Id*: positive integer or word without special characters
+ should be matched to `Id` of Repeat block.

Says to IMAC interpreter that here is the end of a chain of blocks started with Repeat block with the same `Id`.

#### If

## Sending ASCII commands through the terminal

User has a full control over the **IDRIVES** through the Terminal. Refer to the _ASCII Programmerâ€™s Guide_ for available commands and syntax. The syntax of IMAC ASCII message is:

[_usb port_]:[_axis letter_][_command code_][_command parameters_]

Examples:

usb0: 1 g r0x70

Get the value of register `0x70` at axis `1` of **IDRIVE** connected to USB port 0.

usb0: 0 s r0xc8 0

Set the trajectory generator to absolute move, trapezoidal profile

usb0: t 2

Execute homing.
